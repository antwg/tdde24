# This module ties the calendar together. It contains the functions
# that users interact with, and the global dictionary where all
# calendars are stored.

# Functions in this file never delve deeper into the representation of the
# calendar objects, or the internal logic of actually booking an appointment.
# Such code is available in separate modules. These are imported automatically
# upon the import of the calendar module.

# The files have the following dependencies:
